# rspec-book-in-python
The RSpec Book only with all exercises completed in Python/Unittest/Behave instead of Ruby/RSpec/Cucumber

## Some notes on the releases:
### Intro: Chapter 01:
This chapter doesn't have any exercises, so therefore it doesn't have any 
associated code or releases.

### Intro: Chapter 02:
This chapter just has some introductory excercises, so it is independent of the
follow chapter releases containing codebreaker.

### Codebreaker: Chapters 03 - ...
All the work relating to codebreaker is in the codebreaker folder,
which is itself a proper Python project which we could publish to Pypi if we
wanted. Snapshots of the work done at the end of each chapter are captured by 
tags/releases with the name of the chapter.
