# rspec-book-in-python
The RSpec Book only with all exercises completed in Python/Unittest/Behave instead of Ruby/RSpec/Cucumber

## Some notes on the releases:
### Chapter 01:
This chapter doesn't have any exercises, so therefore it doesn't have any 
associated code or releases.

### Chapter 02:
This chapter just has some introductory excercises, so it is independent of the
follow chapter releases containing codebreaker.
