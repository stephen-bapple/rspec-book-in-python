# rspec-book-in-python
The RSpec Book only with all exercises completed in Python/Unittest/Behave
instead of Ruby/RSpec/Cucumber.

These substitutions are done for the following reasons, in order of importance:
- The book claims to be full of lessons that are language agnostic. What better way to drive them home than using a different language?
- The book is fairly old and there isn't a lot of value in learning old versions of a language and its tools.


## Some notes on the releases:
### Intro: Chapter 01:
This chapter doesn't have any exercises, so therefore it doesn't have any 
associated code or releases.

### Intro: Chapter 02:
This chapter just has some introductory excercises, so it is independent of the
following chapter releases containing codebreaker.

### Codebreaker: Chapters 03 - 09
All the work relating to codebreaker is in the codebreaker folder,
which is itself a proper Python project which we could publish to PyPI if we
wanted. Snapshots of the work done at the end of each chapter are captured by 
tags/releases with the name of the chapter.

### Motivation & Background: Chapters 10 - 11
These chapters go over the problems with traditional software projects, 
how Agile methodologies address them, how BDD fits in with Agile, and how
tools like Cucumber and RSpec help to achieve the goals laid out in Agile/BDD.
Although very important and enlightening, there are no direct artifacts for these chapters. 
Therefore there are no releases or code additions/changes.
